# Tanks
A 3D, top-down, two-player local game where players play as tanks and launch rockets at one another. Made with Unity for Game Design 2019.

## Controls
Player One (blue): WASD to move, Space to launch, E to place a mine. <br>
Player Two (red): Arrow keys to move, Enter to launch, ' to place a mine.

## Gameplay
The two players are 3D tanks in a desert canyon. The players are able to launch rockets at each other. The circle around the tanks is the health bar, and decrease as they are hit with rockets or if the tanks hit a placed mine (either their own or by their opponent). The yellow arrow that appears is the vector for the rocket. The longer, the farther the rocket flies. A player wins when they are the first to reach five round wins.

## How to Play
You can download and play the game by downloading the zip file <code>tanks.zip</code>. Extract the files to a folder. The <code>Tanks_Data</code> folder and the <code>Tanks.exe</code> need to be in the same folder in order to run. Run the executable.

## Expansions
In the future, I want to add more UI elements to make this game more user friendly. Although this is a finished game, there are definitely things that could be expanded on.
1. Debug the mine drop for player 1.
2. Add a title and game end screen so the players can choose whether or not to continue.
3. Add an exit function.
